Buongiorno. In this episode we expand the workflow presented in [Part 1](https://datamariano.netlify.app/blog/2022-09-07-merging-spreadsheet-or-csv-files-into-one-dataframe-part-1/) to do a similar operation on much more files belonging to different groups. More precisely, we have the same type of files generated by automatic measurements from different devices and named accordingly to data logger name. \
\
As always, we start with loading the packages we will use.


```r
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
```

And continue with setting the working directory, where we have the files. 




```r
setwd("path/to/Downloads2020")
```

Then we get all filenames we want to read. In the pattern argument of `list.files()` the regex ".*csv$" indicates any character string in filenames ending with ".csv".


```r
filenames <- list.files(pattern = ".*csv$")
```

Printing our `filenames` vector, we can see that we have several files with different logger-associated names.


```r
filenames
```

```
##  [1] "Loggername20200122.csv"       "Loggername20200310.csv"      
##  [3] "Loggername20200522.csv"       "Loggername20200723.csv"      
##  [5] "Loggername20200915.csv"       "Loggername20201027.csv"      
##  [7] "Loggername20210108.csv"       "lovesensors20200122.csv"     
##  [9] "lovesensors20200310.csv"      "lovesensors20200522.csv"     
## [11] "lovesensors20200723.csv"      "lovesensors20200915.csv"     
## [13] "lovesensors20201027.csv"      "lovesensors20210108.csv"     
## [15] "Other-device20200122.csv"     "Other-device20200310.csv"    
## [17] "Other-device20200522.csv"     "Other-device20200723.csv"    
## [19] "Other-device20200915.csv"     "Other-device20201027.csv"    
## [21] "Other-device20210108.csv"     "Time_machine-66_20200122.csv"
## [23] "Time_machine-66_20200310.csv" "Time_machine-66_20200522.csv"
## [25] "Time_machine-66_20200723.csv" "Time_machine-66_20200915.csv"
## [27] "Time_machine-66_20201027.csv" "Time_machine-66_20210108.csv"
```

Since our files belong to different devices, and thus we cannot read and merge all of them into one `data.frame`, we need separate combined `data.frame`s. For this purpose we need the names of our loggers. We can get them from our filenames using the `str_replace()` function with a regex pattern and a replacement argument to extract the names from every filename, nested inside the `unique()` function to have only one name for each logger instead of each file. The good looking regex pattern "([^\_]+)(?:\_)\*\\\d{8}.+" catches any character string that is followed by 8 digits (as the date part of our names) and an optional `_` before the numbers. The replacement "\\\1" refers to the first capturing group "([^\_]+)", meaning that we want to replace our filename string with only that first part that comes before the optional underscore and the 8 numbers. With the "(?:\_)" part we define a non-capturing group to exclude the optional `_`.


```r
logger_names <- unique(str_replace(filenames, "([^_]+)(?:_)*\\d{8}.+", "\\1"))
```

And we can check them printing the vector.


```r
logger_names
```

```
## [1] "Loggername"      "lovesensors"     "Other-device"    "Time_machine-66"
```
Hack. \
\
Before moving on to reading the files, we need the actual year as a vector and the real time with regular intervals for the whole calendar year. In Part 1 we did that after reading the files, but this time we need them before to automate the reading process among devices.




```r
actual_year <- as.integer(str_extract(getwd(), "\\d{4}"))
```

Now we can put the `actual_year` vector into our `make_datetime()` functions when creating the one column `data.frame`.


```r
real_time <- as_tibble_col(seq.POSIXt(make_datetime(actual_year, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0), 
                                  make_datetime(actual_year, 12, 31, 23, 50, 0), 600), 
                       column_name = "Datetime")
```

And here comes the main part. Unlike Part 1 we need a nested for loop now: one loop to iterate over our `logger_names` and another loop inside the first one to iterate over all files for each logger name. In this nested loop construction, we first define the `files_for_one_logger`, followed by initiating an empty `list_for_dataframes`, then comes the inner loop over the `files_for_one_logger` to read the files into the list. In the next steps we bind the rows of our `data.frame`s from the list into a `combined_df`, then `left_join()` it with `real_time` to get our `final_df` that we write into a ".csv" file using the `logger_names` and `actual_year` vectors to define the new filename. As we use temporary objects during the process, we remove all of them with `rm()` in the last step to keep our environment cleaner. Note that we use `name` in the outer loop and `i` in the inner loop. We also expand a bit our reading function, because by default `read_csv()` prints many information about column types guessed by the function so we include `show_col_types = FALSE` to prevent that.


```r
for (name in seq_along(logger_names)){ 
  
  files_for_one_logger <- list.files(pattern = str_c("^", logger_names[name], ".*.csv"))

  list_for_dataframes <- list()

  for (i in seq_along(files_for_one_logger)) {
    list_for_dataframes[[i]] <- read_csv(files_for_one_logger[i], show_col_types = FALSE)
  }

  combined_df <- bind_rows(list_for_dataframes)

  final_df <- left_join(real_time, combined_df, by="Datetime")
  
  write_csv(final_df, str_c(logger_names[name], "_", actual_year, ".csv")) 

 rm(combined_df, final_df, i, name, files_for_one_logger, list_for_dataframes)
 
}
```

Since most times I needed additional cleaning steps, I usually didn't export these `final_df`s immediately. Instead, assigned them into permanent `data.frame`s with the `assign()` function which needs a desired object name as the first argument and the object as the second argument. Then I could repeatedly plot, filter or modify these individual `data.frame`s before writing into file. In this version we simply switch the `write_csv()` function to `assign()`, everything else remain the same as previously.


```r
for (name in seq_along(logger_names)){ 
  
  files_for_one_logger <- list.files(pattern = str_c("^", logger_names[name], ".*.csv"))

  list_for_dataframes <- list()

  for (i in seq_along(files_for_one_logger)) {
    list_for_dataframes[[i]] <- read_csv(files_for_one_logger[i], show_col_types = FALSE)
  }

  combined_df <- bind_rows(list_for_dataframes)

  final_df <- left_join(real_time, combined_df, by="Datetime")
  
  assign(str_c(logger_names[name], "_", actual_year), final_df) 

 rm(combined_df, final_df, i, name, files_for_one_logger)
 
}
```

There is yet another option, when we need our `final_df`s in a list. For that we need to initialize another list to store the `final_df`s.


```r
list_for_final_dfs <- list()
```

Then comes the nested loop, where instead of writing or assigning, we populate the new `list_for_final_dfs` with the `final_df`s, then set the names of these list elements using the actual logger `name` and `actual_year`.


```r
for (name in seq_along(logger_names)){ 
  
  files_for_one_logger <- list.files(pattern = str_c("^", logger_names[name], ".*.csv"))

  list_for_dataframes <- list()

  for (i in seq_along(files_for_one_logger)) {
    list_for_dataframes[[i]] <- read_csv(files_for_one_logger[i], show_col_types = FALSE)
  }

  combined_df <- bind_rows(list_for_dataframes)

  final_df <- left_join(real_time, combined_df, by="Datetime")
  
  list_for_final_dfs[[name]] <- final_df
  names(list_for_final_dfs)[name] <- str_c(logger_names[name], "_", actual_year)

 rm(combined_df, final_df, i, name, files_for_one_logger)
 
}
```

And we can check the contents of `list_for_final_dfs` with `str()` or `glimpse()`.


```r
str(list_for_final_dfs)
```

```

```

And that's all. \
Like in Part 1, this workflow can be adapted easily to input files with “.xls” or “.xlsx” extensions, using the `read_excel()`, `read_xls()` or `read_xlsx()` functions from the `readxl` package, if the files have the same one-row-header format, that is column names are in the first row. \
\
Arrivederci a presto!
