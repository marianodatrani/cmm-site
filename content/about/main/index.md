  My name is *not* Mariano (and I'm not from Trani (and not from the 15-16th centuries)), but everybody knows that any data related website seems more professional with proper presentation, so I decided to redesign his old image into a modern **dataknight** and give him this showman role.  Our joint story started so long ago that in certain parts of Italy I'm simply called Mariano. Probably because I told them *Chiamatemi Mariano! - Call me Mariano!* after realizing that my otherwise not too complicated hungarian real name is too hard for non-hungarian people to pronounce. \
  As a former university researcher my task was for several years to deal with large amounts of environmental data. I couldn't have done it without using R and the Tidyverse packages, which have become my main working tools over the years. During that time I implemented and continuously modified some automated solutions for my everyday tasks that may be useful for others too, so I decided to launch this site where I can collect, store and share my stuff polished into blog posts, together with hobby analyses and visualizations for fun. \
  Recently I focus on online learning and got my Professional Data Scientist Certificate from Datacamp. I have also started to transition to using Python and SQL, but still practice R actively, like here from 2022. My posts are built from R Markdown files with Blogdown and Hugo, deployed using Netlify and presented by Mariano.
