  Or welcome to this site, hosted by Mariano da Trani, *cavaliere bravissimo* of the 15-16th centuries! Being the greatest champion of his time, he was renowned for always helping the poor and the weak. Now, after switching sword to data, he is ready to help the world with coding wizardry. If you want to know more about his greatness, read some Tasso or Ariosto. Or watch some *Il soldato di ventura* where he is the main character (obviously) along with Bud Spencer.
